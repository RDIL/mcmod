# Minecraft Mod Template

This is a template for a Minecraft 1.8.9 mod.

## Features

- [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) is set up already.
- The template is licensed under the unlicense, meaning it is in the public domain.
- Set up so you don't need to touch the build script, only the `gradle.properties` file.

## How to Use

Assuming you know what you are doing, simply:

1. Open this project in IntelliJ
2. Update the project name in `settings.gradle`
3. Update your mod's metadata properties in `gradle.properties`
3. Make your mod
4. Done!
